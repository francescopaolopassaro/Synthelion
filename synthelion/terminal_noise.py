"""Strips terminal control noise (ANSI escapes, spinner frames, progress bars,
in-place carriage-return overwrites) from captured shell output before it reaches
detection/compression.

A captured `npm install`/`vite`/`cargo build` transcript is full of characters that
carry zero information once flattened to plain text: color codes, cursor-movement
sequences, single spinner glyphs cycling on their own line, and `\\r`-driven progress
bars that a real terminal renders as one line but a naive capture stores as thousands
of overwritten variants. None of `LogCompressor`'s dedup logic ever collapses this,
because each raw variant is byte-for-byte distinct before this pass runs.
